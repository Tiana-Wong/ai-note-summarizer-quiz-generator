## 📚 Likely Essay Question Types & How to Answer

### **Type 1: Compare & Contrast Ethical Theories**
*Example: "Compare Kant's Categorical Imperative with Mill's Utilitarianism. How might each approach media ethics differently?"*

**Structure:**
1. **Thesis:** "While both Kant and Mill provide frameworks for ethical decision-making, they differ fundamentally in their approaches: Kant emphasizes duty and universal rules, while Mill focuses on consequences and maximizing overall happiness. These differences create distinct implications for media ethics."

2. **Arguments:**
   - **Kant's approach:** Duty-based (deontological), universal moral law, never use people as means only, emphasis on intent
   - **Mill's approach:** Consequence-based (utilitarian), maximize happiness for greatest number, flexible application, considers outcomes
   - **Application to media:** Kant → journalism must always tell truth regardless of consequences; Mill → journalism should publish if it brings greater good

3. **Framework:** Connect to Potter Box or discuss meta-ethical considerations

4. **Implications:** Real media scenarios (whistleblowing, privacy invasion, misinformation)

5. **Conclusion:** Neither perfect; modern media ethics often combines both approaches

---

### **Type 2: Apply Theory to Real Scenario**
*Example: "A journalist discovers corrupt government officials. Explain how Golden Mean ethics and the Rule of Law would guide their decision-making."*

**Structure:**
1. **Thesis:** "The journalist faces a dilemma where both extremes (publishing everything vs. silence) are problematic. Golden Mean ethics and Rule of Law principles suggest a balanced approach: thorough verification, proper channels, and legal considerations."

2. **Arguments:**
   - **Golden Mean:** Virtue between extremes of recklessness and cowardice
   - **Rule of Law:** Proper procedures, judicial independence, equality before law
   - **Practical steps:** Verify facts, work through legal channels, consider consequences
   - **Professional ethics:** Balance public interest with legal obligations

3. **Framework:** Confucian wisdom + liberal democratic principles

4. **Implications:** Protects journalist, maintains rule of law, serves public interest

5. **Conclusion:** Demonstrates how ancient wisdom applies to modern journalism

---

### **Type 3: Evaluate Concept's Validity**
*Example: "Is the distinction between journalism and PR still meaningful in the digital age? Evaluate using concepts from the course."*

**Structure:**
1. **Thesis:** "While digital convergence has blurred traditional boundaries between journalism and PR, the fundamental distinction remains essential: journalism's primary duty is informing the public; PR's is advocating for clients. However, modern platforms challenge how each maintains integrity."

2. **Arguments:**
   - **Traditional distinction:** Objectivity vs. advocacy, transparency, professional ethics
   - **Digital challenges:** Sponsored content, native advertising, influencer marketing, algorithmic curation
   - **Why distinction matters:** Credibility, trust, accountability, rule of law in information
   - **Contemporary examples:** How major platforms handle journalism vs. PR content

3. **Framework:** Ethics theory + media ethics principles

4. **Implications:** Importance of disclosure, media literacy, platform responsibility

5. **Conclusion:** Distinction essential but requires updated professional standards

---

### **Type 4: Analyze Multi-Dimensional Issue**
*Example: "How do copyright law, innovation incentives, and free expression rights interact? Analyze the tensions using course concepts."*

**Structure:**
1. **Thesis:** "Copyright law, innovation incentives, and free expression exist in tension rather than harmony. Balancing these requires understanding how Rule of Law principles apply differently to each: exclusive rights to creators, openness for innovation and expression, and public benefit for society."

2. **Arguments:**
   - **Copyright's purpose:** Incentivize creation, provide economic rewards
   - **Innovation needs:** Access to existing works, open exchange of ideas, fair use doctrine
   - **Free expression:** Public needs access to information and culture
   - **Legal tools:** Fair use, licensing, Creative Commons, public domain

3. **Framework:** Rawls' justice theory (fair distribution of benefits) + Rule of Law

4. **Implications:** Policy debates (DMCA, fair use in AI, open access), business models

5. **Conclusion:** No perfect solution; requires ongoing negotiation between rights and access

## 📖 Model Essay Example

### **Question:** "Explain how Kant and Mill would approach the decision to publish information about a powerful politician's private life."

### **Sample Essay (450 words):**

**Thesis:** While both Kant and Mill seek to justify ethical actions, their approaches diverge sharply regarding privacy invasion. Kant's deontological ethics forbids using people as mere means, suggesting privacy protection as absolute duty. Mill's utilitarianism, conversely, permits privacy violations if the public benefit exceeds harm. This fundamental disagreement illustrates how ethical frameworks produce conflicting guidance for modern journalism.

**Argument 1 - Kant's Approach:** Kant's Categorical Imperative demands we never use people merely as means to our ends. Publishing private information to increase readership (means to profit) violates this duty—the politician becomes a tool for audience engagement rather than an end in themselves. Kant would insist journalists maintain absolute respect for human dignity, making privacy invasion categorically wrong regardless of public interest. His framework prioritizes universal moral rules over consequences, meaning intent matters more than outcome.

**Argument 2 - Mill's Approach:** Mill's utilitarianism asks whether publication maximizes overall happiness. If the politician's actions affect public policy, revealing them might serve the public interest sufficiently to justify the harm caused. Mill would balance: the politician's privacy loss against potential public benefit from informed voting decisions. Unlike Kant, Mill permits violating individual rights when consequences produce greater overall good. His consequentialist approach is flexible—sometimes publication serves society; sometimes it doesn't.

**Argument 3 - Application to Journalism:** These differences create real tension in media ethics. A Kantian journalist follows strict rules: privacy is inviolable; never use sources as means; always report truth but with respect for dignity. A Millian journalist asks hard questions: Does the public genuinely benefit? Is this information essential to policy evaluation? Can we report with less harm while maintaining truth? The same story receives different treatment.

**Framework Integration:** This demonstrates why media ethics cannot rely on single framework. Professional journalism codes blend both approaches—respecting privacy (Kantian principle) while pursuing public interest (Millian outcome). The Rule of Law similarly protects privacy through law while allowing exceptions serving the public.

**Implications:** Contemporary media crises—celebrity gossip, political opposition research, leaked private communications—hinge on this Kant-Mill tension. Social media amplifies the problem: algorithms reward sensational privacy invasion, pushing even Kantian journalists toward Millian calculations. Understanding this debate helps explain why media credibility erodes when platforms sacrifice privacy for engagement.

**Conclusion:** Neither framework alone guides journalism adequately. Kant's absolutism sometimes protects the powerful at public expense; Mill's flexibility sometimes permits unjust invasions of privacy. Professional journalists must navigate between these positions, defending privacy rigorously while serving legitimate public interest—a balance that requires both ethical principles and wise judgment.
