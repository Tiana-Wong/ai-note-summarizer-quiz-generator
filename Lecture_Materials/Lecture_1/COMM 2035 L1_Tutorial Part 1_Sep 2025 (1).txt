●●Procedural justiceis concerned with making and implementing decisions according to fair processes that ensure "fair treatment."Rules must be impartially followed and consistently applied in order to generate an unbiased decision.•Those carrying out the procedures should be neutral, and those directly affected by the decisions should have some voice or representation in the decision-making process.•If people believe procedures to be fair, they will be more likely to accept outcomes, even ones that they do not like.•Implementing fair procedures is central to many dispute resolution procedures, includingnegotiation,mediation,arbitration,andadjudication.Retributive justice•••Retributive justiceappeals to the notion of "just desert" --the idea that people deserve to be treated in the same way they treat others.It is a retroactive approach that justifies punishment as a response to past injustice or wrongdoing.The central idea is that the offender has gained unfairadvantagethrough his or her behavior, and that punishment will set this imbalance straight.•In other words, those who do not play by the rules should be brought to justice and deserve to suffer penalties for their transgressions.•The notion of deterrence also plays in here: the hope is that the punishment for committing a crime is large enough that people will not engage in illegal activities because the risk of punishment is too high.•Retributive justice also plays a central role in international legalproceedings,respondingtoviolationsofinternationallaw,humanrights,andwarcrimes. Restorative justice•There is a tendency to slip from retributive justice to an emphasis on revenge, some suggestthatrestorative justiceprocessesare more effective.•While a disciplinary justice approach conceives of transgressions as crimes against the state or nation, restorative justice focuses on violations as crimes against individuals.•It is concerned with healingvictims' wounds, restoring offenders to law-abiding lives, and repairing harm done to interpersonal relationships and the community.• Victims take an active role in directing the exchange that takes place, as well as defining the responsibilities and obligations of offenders.•Restorative justice aims to strengthen the community andprevent similar harms from happening in the future.ReferenceTypesofJustice,byMichelle Maieseand Heidi Burgess, Beyond IntractabilityOriginal written by Michelle Maieseand published July 2003;updated by Heidi Burgess in June 2013, and again in July, 2020.https://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/types_of_justice#:~:text=This%2     0a rticle%20points%20out%20that,All%20four%20of%20these%20areReadingJustice and Fairness, Markkula Centerfor Applied Ethics, byManuel Velasquez, Claire Andre, Thomas Shanks, S.J., and Michael J.

it does not even mean having nodiscussions with the legislature or the executive.•It means that the legislature and theexecutive should not be able to exert improper influenceover the judges.•Neither the legislature nor the executive should be able to interfere with, or influence, judicial decision-making (other than by advancing normal legal argument in cases).Filming in the Court•Filming proceedings in the CFA ( Court of Final Appeal ) would be appropriate in principle or proportionate in terms of cost.•It is fair to say that, at least in the face of it, cameras in court can be seen as a logical extension to open justice, and open justice is a fundamental aspect of the rule of law, as I have mentionedReference and videoWhy we need cameras in court ?THE CONVERSATION , Academic rigour , journalistic flair , 29 March 2016https://theconversation.com/why-we-need-cameras-in- court- 56839Reference ReadingJudges, Access to Justice, the Rule of Law and the Court of Final Appeal under “One Country Two Systems”.David Neuberger , University of Hong Kong, 13 September 2017https://www.hkcfa.hk/filemanager/speech/en/upload/1195/Judges,%20Access%20to%20Justice,%20the%20  Rule%20of%20Law%20and%20the%20Court%20of%20Final%20Appeal%20under%20%E2%80%9COne%20Countr y%20Two%20Systems%E2%80%9D.pdfMedia law and regulation•The role of the media, both mass media, community media and small and medium-sized media outlets, is instrumental in realizing and exercising the right to freedom of expression.•Media regulation is enforced by of law, rules or procedures and varies across the world.•They ought to protect freedom of expression and media freedom and regulate media markets, ownership, infrastructure and technical standards and, importantly, protect public interests such as media pluralism and diversity.RegulationDifferent parts of the media landscapes can be regulated in different ways:•Self-regulation: a system of self-regulation where news media(collectively) draw up their own regulations and take full responsibility for monitoring compliance with those regulations through a media council.•Statutory-regulation: The state sets the relevant legislative or regulatory rules and monitors and enforces compliance in a transparent way.•Co-regulation: a hybrid form where self-regulation ultimately is back- stopped by statutory regulation.Areas of statutory regulation can differ greatly per country, but common areas for a regulator are:•broadcasting regulation and frequency allocation •infrastructural regulation•Internet regulation•advertising and election broadcasting•protection of independence public media and operationalautonomy•(cross-) media ownership•media diversity•licensing and taxationIn countries with limited space for independent media, state regulators typically control:•publishing andlicensing •content•issuing of press cards•Internet accessReference and video :Social media regulation: why we must ensure it is democratic and inclusiveBy Rowan Cruft and Natalie Alana Ashton , INFORRM’s BLOG , 3 May 2022https://inforrm.org/2022/05/03/social-media-regulation-why- we-must-ensure-it-is-democratic-and-inclusive-rowan-cruft-and-natalie-alana-ashton/⚫Not only political and legal pressure, commercial influence is also important.Economic enabling environmentWith the decline in readership and –since the advent of socialmedia and search platforms –advertising income, commercial media outlets, big and small, have seen their business models rendered obsolete, forcing them to find new ways to attract readership and income.•Part of the economic enabling environment for media is determined by the structure and concentration of media ownership, competition policy, the costs of establishing media and having access to advertising and state-subsidies, next to the overall economic situation of a country and ability and willingness to pay for content.Reference ReadingTHE RELATION BETWEEN ETHICS AND LAW ,by Georgeta-Bianca SPÎRCHEZ*Fiat IustitiaNo. 1/2016https://oaji.net/articles/2016/2064-1480331083.pdf DiscussionThe Singapore Government said :“ The Western idea of the press as the fourth estate of the realm, as an adversarial watchdog of government, goes against our goal of consensus politics...Accurately reporting wrongdoings is a legitimate role...

•An ethical dilemma is a situation that involves a choice, decision, act/action, or solution that may include an unpleasant problem or situation where you feel you simply do not know what to do or which way to turn.•When identifying what is or is not an ethical dilemma, we need to remember the key words: moral or ethical  ( we are using these words interchangeably ).•A response to an ethical dilemma is not always a matter of “right versus wrong,” as both courses of action or decision could seem moral or ethical.•It is the “right versus right” ethical dilemmas that seem to be the hardest to resolve.•In some cases, you have to decide the better or best way to respond when faced with two or more “right “courses of action or decisions to select from. •When faced with an ethical dilemma, you will probably be asking yourself “What should I do?” or “What ought I do now?”   •You may have a “little voice” inside your head telling you to do one thing, while your immediate desire is to do another. •Some may refer to this “little voice” as your conscience, wisdom, or experiences.•No matter what it is, the “ little voice “ should be guided by a set of ethical principles.Ethical Dilemmas In Movies⚫Whatethicaldilemmasdomoviesprovoke?
•Movies with ethical dilemmas offer captivating stories and thought-provoking moral quandaries, challenging both the characters and the audience's decision-making.•They present complex choices, such as compromising morals for the greater good or making impossible decisions in dire circumstances.•They showcase the moral grey areas and tough positions the characters face, leaving viewers pondering what they would do in similar situations.•Vertical Limit•Saving Private Ryan•Inception•楢山節考
