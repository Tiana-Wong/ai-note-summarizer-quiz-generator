20 Oct 2025



Pro Arguments ( Journalism contradicts PR )



1. Different Objectives : Journalism aims to inform the public and uncover the truth, while PR focuses on promoting a specific agenda or image.

   

2. Ethical Standards : Journalists adhere to strict ethical guidelines that prioritize objectivity, whereas PR professionals may prioritize persuasion and image management.



3. Transparency vs. Spin : Journalism values transparency and accountability, while PR often involves crafting messages that may obscure the truth.



4. Conflict of Interest : PR professionals may influence journalists through press releases and events, potentially compromising journalistic integrity.



5. Public Trust : The public may view PR as manipulative, leading to skepticism about information presented in the media, which can undermine journalistic credibility.



Con Arguments (Journalism and PR can coexist)



1. Mutual Benefit : Both fields can benefit from each other; PR provides information that can be valuable for journalists, and journalists help PR by amplifying messages.



2. Evolving Roles : Journalists increasingly engage in PR-like activities, such as managing their own brands or using social media to promote their stories.



3. Collaborative Opportunities : Investigative journalism can uncover stories that PR professionals need to address, leading to a more informed public.



4. Shared Goals : Both aim to communicate effectively with audiences, and good PR can enhance the quality of the information journalists receive.



5. Ethical PR : Some PR professionals prioritize ethical practices and honesty, aligning more closely with journalistic standards than traditionally perceived.



Questions to be discussed :



- Can there be a balance between ethical journalism and effective PR ?

- How do different media landscapes (social media vs. traditional media) impact the relationship between journalism and PR ?

- Are there notable examples where journalism and PR have successfully collaborated for a common goal ?



Ethical dilemma cases commonly encountered in the PR industry:



1. Misleading Information : A PR agency is asked to promote a product with exaggerated claims that are not fully substantiated by research. Should they proceed with the campaign ?



2. Client Confidentiality vs. Public Safety : A PR professional discovers that their client is knowingly endangering public health. Should they break confidentiality to inform the public?



3. Crisis Management and Truth : During a crisis, a company’s PR team is instructed to downplay the severity of the issue to protect the brand. Should they prioritize the company’s image over transparency?



4. Paid Influencers : A PR firm hires influencers to promote a product without disclosing that they are being paid. Is this ethical, and should it be disclosed to the audience?



5. Selective Disclosure : A PR team has access to sensitive information about a competitor that could significantly impact the market. Should they use this information to their advantage?



6. Spin vs. Truth : A corporation faces backlash for unethical practices. The PR team is tasked with creating a narrative that shifts blame. Should they engage in spinning the story?



7. Social Media Manipulation : A PR agency creates fake social media accounts to generate positive buzz for a client. Is this an acceptable strategy for gaining attention?



8. Diversity and Inclusion : A PR campaign lacks diversity in representation, despite the company’s claims of valuing inclusivity. Should the PR team push back against the client’s vision?



9. Compromised Journalism : A PR professional offers gifts or incentives to journalists in exchange for favorable coverage. Is this a standard practice or an ethical violation?



10. Whistleblower Protection : An employee approaches a PR firm with allegations of misconduct within their organization. Should the PR team advise the organization to address the issue or protect the client’s reputation?
