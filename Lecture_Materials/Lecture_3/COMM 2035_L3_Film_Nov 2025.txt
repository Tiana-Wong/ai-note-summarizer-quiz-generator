COMM 2035 Communication, Ethics and LawLecture 3 Ethics/Law and Film MakingPart 1Professor KC CHAN Raymond R. Wong Endowed Professor in Media EthicsProfessor of Practice Semester 1 , 2025 / 26Filmmakers attempt to balance several principles in their work •Box Office Hit•Aesthetic / Artistic Values•Political Articulation•Amusement•Social ResponsibilitiesWhat are the ethics of filmmaking?Aesthetics and EthicsFilm making is a form of aesthetic activity•Aesthetics can offer us insights about objects: the beautiful woman, the gorgeous portrait, the hideous cesspool, and so on.•Aesthetics can offer us insights about sounds: the beautiful music, the sweet voice, the grating rant, and so on.•Aesthetics can offer us insights about actions: the kind gesture, the rude remark, the generous help, the callous betrayal.•Indeed, almost everything a person can experience can be processed in accordance to how beautiful or how ugly it is.•Taking all of this into account, it is plain to see that aesthetics are a big part of being human.It is useful to keep in mind that ethics does not apply as broadly as aesthetics does.Aesthetics typically has something to say about everything imaginable, while ethics only applies to a few things.When considering whether or not to paint a house, one’s aesthetic sense is pondering millions of questions: What colour? What pattern? What paint(s)? What kind of finish? What brush type? What brush technique? What budget? What approach? And so on… and there is no right or wrong answer to these questions.Meanwhile, the ethical centre of one’s brain is only asking a few questions: Is the house mine? Are the painting materials mine? If the answer to both questions is “yes”, then that’s it. You’re free to do what you wish.When considering all this, it is advisable that when making a decision, ethical considerations should take precedence over aesthetic considerations.This is not intended to denigrate aesthetics. Aesthetics are a big part of life, they’re valuable, enjoyable, they help us to understand who we are, and what is important to us, while ethics can at times feel like an endless killjoy and burden to carry through life.In fact, the tendency is that the more self-knowledge a person has, the more enjoyable ethical behaviour is for them because they can see the hidden beauty in doing the right thing and justice becomes its own reward.Reference : Aesthetics and Ethics,PHILOSOPHICALTHERAPIST ,11 June 2017https://philosophicaltherapist.com/2017/ 06/11/aesthetics-and-ethics/Hong Kong Film Industry Industry DataHong Kong has one of the largest and most dynamic film industries in the world. As a major centre for the production of film and television content, the city has captured a fair share of the regional market, particularly in mainland China.As a regional hub for buying and selling Asian films and TV dramas, Hong Kong is widely recognized as a superb platform for co-production.The Hong Kong International Film & TV Market (FILMART) is Asia’s leading content marketplace.•For the past two years it has taken place online, providing a virtual content trading and meeting platform for industry players during the Covid-19 crisis.•More than 7,000 international buyers from 81 countries and regions attended the four-day event in March 2021, when some 2,200 film and television productions were released and promoted.•Hong Kong's audio-visual services industry has gained preferential access under the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA)to the mainland’s huge entertainment media market.•Following the implementation of the CEPA agreement concerning the Mainland’s Specific Commitments on Liberalization of Trade in Services for Hong Kong in mid-2016, an Amendment Agreement was introduced with new 2016, an Amendment Agreement was introduced with new liberalization measures for motion pictures (film) and television industries, among others, effective from 1 June 2020.Film Distribution •The Covid-19 pandemic has upended the global film industry.•In line with strict social distancing requirements, cinemas have been closed and film production suspended for a prolonged period since the onset of the Covid-19 outbreak.•The result was a plunge in box office receipts in 2020 for most regions, including mainland China (-68%), Hong Kong (-72%) and North America (-80%).Industry Development and Market Outlook•According toHong Kong Box Office Limited, 63 cinemaswere operating in Hong Kong as of October 2021, up from 45 at the end of 2013.

Circuit.Hong Kong's film industry is reliant on overseas revenue, given the limited size of the domestic market, with Asia accounting for the majority of foreign sales income.According to the American media measurement and analytics CompanyComscore, the mainland film market surpassed that of North America to become the world’s biggest film market in 2020, accounting for one-fourth of the global box receipts.For the year, three Hong Kong-mainland co-productions –namelyLeap(奪冠),ShockWave2(拆彈專家2) andCaught in Time(除暴)–ranked among the mainland’s top 10 highest-grossing movies.•While the mainland market has opened up for film co-production and is signing more agreements with overseas counterparts, Hong Kong remains its primary co- production partner.•In the first eight months of 2020, 30 out

three-tier film classification system.Film Classification In Hong KongUnder the Film Censorship Ordinance (Cap. 392), films intended for public exhibition must be approved by the Film Censorship Authority (FCA).Films are either classified into the three-tier classification system or exempted from classification(examples of films eligible for exemption include educational, cultural, religious and promotional films).The three-tier film classification system according to the Ordinance is as follows:Category ISuitable for All AgesCategory IIANot Suitable for ChildrenCategory IIBNot Suitable for Young Persons and ChildrenCategory IIIPersons Aged 18 or Above Only••Categories IIA and IIB are advisory in nature, while the age restriction for Category III films is legally enforced.Advertising materials for Category III films and packaging of the physical storage medium of Category III films (such as video disc) also require the approval of the FCA.•Categories IIA and IIB are advisory in

classification system in an objective aggrieved by a decision of the FCA or censor may request manner. Under general circumstances, a person who is theBoard of Review (Film Censorship)to review the decision.Film Classification SystemHow does a censor classify films ? What factors would the censor consider when classifying a film for public exhibition ?Under section 10 of the Film Censorship Ordinance (Cap. 392) (FCO), a censor has to take into consideration the following matters when making a decision:1.Whether the film portrays, depicts or treats cruelty, torture, violence, crime, horror, disability, sexuality or indecent or offensive language orbehavior;2.Whether the film denigrates or insults any particular class of the public by reference to the colour, race, religious beliefs or ethnic or national origins or the sex of the members of that class; and3.Whether the exhibition of the film would be contrary to the interests of national security.The censor shall also take into account the following matters when making a decision:1.the effect of the film as a whole and its likely effect on the persons likely to view the film;2.the artistic, educational, literary or scientific merit of the filmand its importance or value for cultural or social reasons; and3.in relation to the intended exhibition of the film, the circumstances of such exhibition What are the classification standards for the use of language in films ?Expressions or expletives with sexual connotations and those normally used specifically in the context of certain criminal groups in Hong Kong are not permitted in Category I films.In Category IIA films, mild expletives with sexual connotations and coarse language may be used only infrequently and must be contextually justified.In deciding between Category IIB and III, the degree of offensiveness of any such language will be considered.Is the depiction ofnudity allowed only in category III films ?The depiction of nudity is an established art form, but full-length frontal nudity in a film that can be watched by children is generally not tolerated by local audiences.Such depiction is not normally permitted in a Category I film.Depictions of nudity in Category IIA films should be carried out with tact and discretion, and nudity depicted in a sexually suggestive manner should not be permitted.In considering whether to pass films depicting nudity for Category IIB or III, the censor will consider the degree of the possible erotic effect of that nudity.Are the standards for television programmes similar to film classification standards?Television and film are different media, and hence different regulatory systems apply.Film Censorship (Amendment) Bill 2021Legislators have passed a bill to toughen Hong Kong’s film censorship law, authorising the city’s No 2 official to ban productions that undermine national security and increasing the maximum jail term for anyone who screens movies already classified as a threat.The changes allow the government to extend the vetting period from the usual two weeks to as long as 28 days so censors can seek legal advice before deciding.Unauthorized screenings can result in a maximum jail sentence of three years, up from two, and a HK$1 million (US$128,570) fine under the changes to the Film Censorship Ordinance, which also enable the chief secretary to ban the showing of previously approved productions on national security grounds.Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Edward Yau Tang-wahsaid most movies would not be affected and the new rules would not undermine the industry.“Our objective is simple and direct –it is to improve our film censorship system and effectively prevent and suppress any act that would endanger national security,” he said during the Legco meeting.“I believe that most films would not have any national security consideration … This bill would provide clear rules for the industry to follow, so that they would not cross the red lines accidentally.”But some professionals and commentators raised fears that creativity and freedom of expression would suffer.TenkyTin Kai-man, spokesman for the Federation of Hong Kong Filmmakers, said the impact of the new rules remained to be seen, “ we would hope it’s not a sweeping hit, but it depends on how far authorities would go.”Independent theatres would also probably think twice before screening documentaries, especially those touching on social disobedience or the police, he said.Kenny Ng Kwok-kwan, an associate professor at Baptist University’s Academy of Film, said the industry had accepted that authorities were tightening their grip over the creative arts.“The industry was expecting that the changes would be passed so filmmakers were already anticipating how to operate under the new environment,” he said.Reference :Hong Kong passes bill to ban films deemed threats to national security, increase penalty for unauthorized screenings, by Tony Cheung, SCMP. 27 October

Kong’s was once one of the most distinctive.Although it owes a large debt to its mainland heritage, Hong Kong cinema helped popularise entire genres of film such as kung fu and wuxia on top of creating specifically local genres like molei tau comedies and heroic bloodshed action films.A Brief History of Hong Kong Film IndustryDuring its heyday from the mid-80s to the mid-90s Hong Kong films dominated the box office in East Asia and enjoyed a cult reputation in the West.Despite the city’s size, it exported more films than every other country in the world except the United States. Local stars Jackie Chan and John Woo became bona fide Hollywood celebrities and the likes of Chow Yun-fat and Jet Li also had the chance to shine Stateside.According to film historian David Bordwell, at its peak Hong Kong produced “arguably the world’s most energetic, imaginative popular cinema”.The first film of fiction made in Hong Kong is generally accepted to beChuang TsiTests His Wife, made in 1913.Although by 1939 local studios were making more than 100 films per year, in both Cantonese and Mandarin, the then British colony was second to Shanghai in cinematic importance.Local filmmakers took advantage of all of this and prospered.With Chinese communities spread throughout Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia –not to mention Taiwan –Hong Kong movies had eager audiences across Asia. In the 60s, studios mimicked the popular Japanese jidaigeki samurai films, producing their own Chinese equivalent such as the hugely popularCome Drink With Me(1966) andThe One-Armed Swordsman(1967).Then came Bruce Lee. An international icon to this day.Lee’s break out role was inThe Big Boss (1971).His break out role was inThe BigBoss(1971), which set box office records across Asia. Lee’s follow-up,Fists of Fury(1972), broke those same records and his final film,Enter the Dragon(1973), released posthumously, made him an international star even after his untimely death.Unfortunately, the situation could not last. The turning point was 1993 whenJurassic Parkstomped into view and topped the Hong Kong box office.The same year, Taiwan, long the most lucrative overseas market, saw the introduction of cable and satellite television, enticing viewers to stay at home rather than visit the cinema.During the peak years of production in the early 90s, per capita Hong Kong had the most active film industry on the planet.With a huge number of investors seeking a quick buck in this buoyant market –including triad gangs, a dark side to the boom years –the result was overproduction of poor quality movies.The film industry never recovered from this succession of blows –blows that kept coming with the likes of Sars and mainland China’s determination to push its own cinema.Must Read How did the Hong Kong film industry get so big –and why did it fall into decline?The Hong Kong film industry once producedstars like Bruce Lee, Chow Yun-fat and Wong Kar-wai: how did it get so big, and why did it fall ?

Many other women in the film industry subsequently reported similar experiences with Weinstein.In 2019, the documentary Untouchable was released with interviews from several of his accusers. Weinstein was charged by theNew York County District Attorney‘s Officewith "rape, criminal sex act, sex abuse and sexual misconduct for incidents involving two separate women" on May 25, 2018. He was arrested the same day after surrendering to theNewYork City Police Department(NYPD).The Dark Side of Hollywood Icon Jerry Lewis | Vanity Fair , 23 February 2022.https://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=ddH-T91K0tUVideoEthics in Documentary Film The Centerfor Media and Social Impact concluded that filmmakers shared three general ethical principlesthat they attempted to balance in their work:1.Honoryour (vulnerable) subjects.2.Protect them from attack and don't leave them worse off than when you met them.3.Honoryour viewers. Make sure that what they understand to be true and real wouldn't be betrayed if you told them where and how you got that image.Thinking more deeply:In circumstances where filmmakers are working with vulnerable subjects, how can they ensure that the subjects are able to provide informed consent?What other options did the subjects have?Were the subjects able to entrust their stories to this filmmaker because they were the best option (or were they the only option)?What rights or protections should be provided to subjects who are survivors of violent trauma?Should their stories be handled any differently than those of other subjects? Why or why not?Should subjects reserve the right to withdraw consent? Under what circumstances?When children are the subject of a documentary, how can consent be fairly given?What are the potential benefits and problems with parents or guardians having the authority to give consent on the child’s behalf? What responsibility, if any, does the filmmaker have to the future adult who will live with the decisions made on their behalf when they wereyoung?Honest Truths: Ethics in Documentary Film byALLISON MILEWSKI, AMERICAN DOCUMENTARYhttps://www.amdoc.org/engage/resources/honest-truths-ethics-documentary-film/honest-truths- documentary-filmmakingethics/#:~:text=Ultimately%2C%20the%20Center%20for%20Media,Honor%20your%20viewers.Documentary filmmaking requires acknowledgement and application of industry ethics such as integrity of content and respectful, non- exploitative filming relationships.Audiences are typically unconcerned about filmmaking ethics, particularly in reference to science and educational films.It is, however, under this categorical umbrella that some of the most serious ethical grievances have taken place.•Wildlife and environmental filmmaking involves perhaps the most complicated issues of ethics due to the position of its subjects.•Animals cannot control their media representation, nor can they give consent to their relationships with filmmakers.Why the concern about ethics in wildlife filmmaking?The violations of ethics in this field have an influence on the spread of educational information and human-environmental relations.Ethics in Wildlife Filmmaking •There are numerous instances of ethical transgressions, rangingfrom lack of transparency and audience deception to animal harassment and abuse. •Animal abuse and harassment is used to provoke desired •Harassing animals can put both the animals and the production crew at physical risk.•Additionally, harassment can lead to a disruption of normal animal behavior; this creates unrealistic expectations for viewers on animal behavior.•On-screen harassment, which occurs at times with “reality” programming and films with thrill narratives, creates an inappropriate representation of human-animal relations.Animal Fight Night(Nat Geo Wild, 2013) is a series that features battles between some of the biggest and fiercest animals in the world, including lions, hippopotami, wolves, bison and crocodiles. National Geographic claims the programs will deliver “the bright lights, drama and testosterone of the Ultimate Fighting Championship.”To create the series, National Geographic hired a British production company called Arrow Media, which, in turn, quietly put the word out to young, hungry cinematographers that they were looking for exciting animal fight footage.This resulted in the following post on Facebook on March 26, 2014, from an impecunious young filmmaker hoping to get hired by Arrow Media: “I need to film bobcats and mountain lions fighting, and also red squirrels, coach whips and raccoons fighting. I’m looking for help.”The filmmaker’s Facebook post resulted in an explosion of outrage over young filmmakers being pressured to behave unethically by staging animal fights. As more and more filmmakers andphotographers weighed in and the discussion became more heated, the original post was suddenly deleted by the young filmmaker, who clearly regretted the post and the uproar and embarrassment it had caused.Ratings and money can be a powerful driving force towards unethical actions in filming.Animal harassment and cruelty are only the tip of the iceberg. Average audiences would seldom suspect that wildlife films and television programming would prey on audience trust through deliberate deception.From : When Wildlife Documentaries Harass: Ethics Required in Environmental Filmmaking Too , by Chris Palmer , Documentary , 15 April 2015.https://www.documentary.org/feature/when -wildlife-documentaries-harass-ethics- required-environmental-filmmaking-tooEND
