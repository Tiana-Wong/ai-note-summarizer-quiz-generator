Relationship Between Ethics and Law

 

Ethics is a set of standards, or a code, or value system, worked out from
human reason and experience, by which free human actions are determined as
ultimately right or wrong, good or evil. If acting agrees with these
standards, it is ethical, otherwise unethical.Law is a code of conduct
which the authority in power prescribes for society.



It basically differs from ethics in its option to use force if and when
necessary and by the fact that it is backed by power. Laws are, by and
large, fair and moral. But it is not easy to accept that laws can be the
foundations of ethics, or even that laws can ensure ethical behaviour.



There are many situations in life, where just following the law does not
make one ethical. For example, if a wealthy man intends to splash thousands
of Ghana Cedis on the anniversary of his dog whiles his neighbour has no
money to buy food and is being ejected from his home, there is no law to
prohibit the wealthy man from doing so. If he decides not to, it is because
of the dictates of his conscience, not because of the dictates of the law.
His conscience, ethical value system and principles forbid him to rejoice
when someone else nearby is in sorrow.



The law has no role to play in such a situation. Moreover, not all laws
have moral choice. There are many laws which do not involve any ethicality
questions - for example, we are required to walk on the left hand side of
the road. This is done to ensure traffic control and the traffic
discipline, but a question of ethics is not involved here. 



Again, all moral and ethical actions do not involve the law. For example,
it is ethical to love and respect your parents, but there is no law for it,
except when they are deliberately mistreated by their children.



Law represents the minimum standards of behaviour expected from people.
Merely following the law, does not make one ethical. Another aspect
