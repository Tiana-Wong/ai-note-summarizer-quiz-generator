The relevance of professionalism in the changing sector of
journalism
Jan Green
Introduction
The labelling of journalism as a profession continues to come under scrutiny as the immedi-
acy of news expands in an era of digitalization, 24/7 live feeds and the decreasing margin of
distinction between professionalism and amateurism, widely referred to as citizen-journalism.
This article draws on an international sample of papers and provides an initial commentary
on the emergence, and application, of the term professionalism, followed by the make-up and
widely recognised attributes of a profession. The focus of journalism as a specific example
of professionalism is then reviewed and reveals the ongoing and widespread changes that are
impacting on this sector.
Defining professionalism
In searching for a definitive answer to the question about professionalism, there isn’t one!
However, Cogan (1955) provides an insight into the complexities of the concept, that remain
relevant in 2021, proffering a view that a profession is both observable and measurable. This
involves an individual adhering to the rules of professional conduct, one who has participated
in a specialist education and demonstrates standards of competence. Relationships are devel-
oped with clients, colleagues and the public. Cogan adds that the advantages of an operational
definition has a tendency to stabilise boundaries between genuine professionalism, unprofes-
sionalism and non-professionalism.

is the possession of special training which supports the acquisition of an intellectual technique
and that ‘a profession can only be said to exist when there are bonds between the practitioners,
and these bonds can take but one shape – that of formal association.’ Carr-Saunders and
Wilson 1933: 298). In order to achieve membership and recognition within a profession,
Cogan (1955) emphasises the completion of training, which may be arduous and require a
personal commitment to an exacting ethical code, adding that failure in either of these domains
is a failure of professionalism. Overall, the challenge of acceptance has incorporated effective
and on-going public relations. In the absence of robustness, a profession could anticipate the
gradual dissolution of the core attributes that were the original foundations of growth.
According to Trede (2012), professionalism is a fluid concept which is not bound by spe-
cific rules, is context dependent and apparent as a result of professional identity, which may
be a role or accreditation via a recognised body. A competency-based approach erodes the
fluid aspect of professionalism which should not be viewed in conjunction with a set of rules,
the outcome being a fixed and static situation. Professionalism encompasses decision-making
in context, responsible judgements and actions founded on a clear knowledge of what an in-
dividual stands for in terms of values and interests. A sense of professional identity in terms
of actions, thoughts and a way of being are the underpinning aspects of professionalism. An
opposing view is put forward by Power (2008) that properties of autonomy, trust, concern
for client needs and a shared moral language are, at best, aspirational, more imagined than
real and therefore should not be viewed as an accurate empirical description of professional
practice.
Being a professional suggests an expert occupation (Evetts, 2013) linked with being wor-
thy of trust. The expansion of the term professional and the frequency with which the word
is now used in connection with marketing and advertising of products and services - where it
supports segmentation and has a broader appeal is a further view proposed by Evetts (2013).
In addition, the term professionalism has gained a strong foothold in the management liter-
ature providing links to positions and behaviours in many sectors and spheres. The result
being further lack of clarity related to a widely agreed definition for professionalism. Power
(2008) emphasises the impact of the information age enabling rapid and widespread acquisi-
tion of expertise and the subsequent erosion of the exclusivity of the knowledge base that is
the foundation upon which professionals gain status. This factor is a mechanism of change
which has impacted on the components of professionalism and the ways in which they re-
late to each other. This contributes to the compelling tension between the perception of the
expert, modern professional who is independent, influential, well rewarded, respectable and
client-focused and the anxiety riddled reality of being overwhelmed.

professionalism, from a historical perspective, suggests the concept is evolving and changing
which lacks uncontested definitions and traits and is, in essence, an artificial construct.
Journalism as a Profession
Journalists were officially identified as elite professionals and transformed from previous ref-
erences to literary men through the formation of the Shanghai Journalists Association under
the Chinese Guomindang influence in 1920. This initiative was part of the groundswell to
distinguish between profession and occupation in the Chinese language (Crook, 2008). In the
western world there were initiatives to license journalists as it was widely recognised that in-
dividuals entered the field without preparation or experience of any kind. There was support
for ‘such emerging professionalizing agents as journalism schools, professional organizations
and ethics code.” (Cronin 1993:235). This era of formalization is being reconstructed against
the backdrop of seismic changes confronting the field (Vos and Thomas, 2018) due to ad-
vancements and access to technology. The historical roots of newspapers and diversification
of journalism have emerged in an era of digitalization and impacts on the future security of
what has been a market-driven profession.
Schnell (2018) refers to journalism as a profession emerging alongside modern mass me-
dia which experiences tension between a public duty and widespread commercialization of the
media, a growing change during the final quarter of the 20th century which provided tremen-
dous development opportunities. However, alongside the opportunities came the threat of
amateurs, which has resulted in the opposite situation to that experienced in sport where the
rise of the professional has been exponential, (Crook, 2008).
The pathways to professional journalism, identified by Schnell (2018) are similar to those
previously identified in the wider professionalism section. They are outlined as the watchdog
with social proximity, objectivity which encompasses neutrality and impartiality to legitimize
media practitioners, autonomy with freedom of opinion, ethics to ensure trust and immediacy
with novelty. These traits can be summarized as an expert role. However, the growth in the
academization of journalism introduced a fundamental change from a profession of talent to a
profession of qualification, eroding the traditional view that journalism is craftwork, learned
in the field.
Of these traits, immediacy is an increasing priority with the growth and expansion of
24/7, real-time publishing with complex consequences linked to social change. This stems
from a transformation of audience expectations which is increasingly fragmented, complex
and even participatory, which is evidenced by the growing practice of a journalist interviewing

Deuze (1999) identified three key differences as online influences emerged. Interaction
with the audience, asking for views and exchanges, which is a cultural change with the po-
tential to provide faster access to stories. Personalization or individualization which merges
with the arena of marketing and includes the use of hyperlinks to push or pull other sources.
Convergence is ‘the melting of these traditional media forms of image and text into one story’
(Deuze, 1999:379). In terms of skills, writing should be non-linear to enable chunks of con-
tent to be extracted and reused elsewhere. The vast array of resources is contributing to the
role of the emerging opinion that the journalist is, more or less, superfluous.
As a result, journalism is increasingly prefixed with other terms. Cyber-journalism or
network journalism are used by Schnell (2018), both reinforce the views previously expressed
by Deuze, (1999). The format is multi-media story packages created by a team to engage in
economic competition and work is measured in the countable pieces of words, paragraphs
and illustrations. These work practices have the potential to result in deskilling, where the
technological issues have greater prominence than writing.
An alternative term, ‘citizen journalist’ is gaining prominence. Luo and Harrison (2019)
link this aspect of journalism to postings, hashtags, links and ratings. This is a widespread
process in Western nations using media content as a starting point to participate as a con-
tent creator and ultimately generating the power to influence and reverse opinion. Darbo and
Skjerdal (2019) add that professional journalists are under threat and media-houses them-
selves also actively encourage user-generated content which has an increasing attraction for
the twenty first century multi-layered media society. Whilst opposing views linked to the
hybridization of journalism where the lack of obvious distinctions results in ‘some loss of
relevance,’ (Singer, et al., 2013) the opposing view appreciates that reader-generated content
is beneficial when a collaborative approach is adopted, there is clear merit in reader retention
who support circulation numbers and contribute to the sales revenue stream.
Conclusion
From the growth and distinctive traits of professionalism, journalism has undergone exten-
sive change where the difference between layperson and professional has narrowed so that the
point of blurring is more accurately described as overlapping. According to the American
Press Institute the average person works like a journalist and is now his or her own circulation
manager and editor. The relationship between the journalist and the reader has fundamen-
tally changed; it will continue to do so. The popular view that everyone is a journalist will
strengthen and be endorsed by evolving practice and the continued widespread use and appli-
