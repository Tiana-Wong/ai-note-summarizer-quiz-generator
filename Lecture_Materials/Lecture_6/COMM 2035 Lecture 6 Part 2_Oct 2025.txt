COMM 2035 Communication, Ethics and Law Lecture 6 Ethics / Law andJournalism Part II Professor KC CHAN Semester 1, 2025 / 26 Raymond R. Wong Endowed Professor in Media Ethics Professor of PracticeDigital media ethics••Digital media ethics deals with the distinct ethical problems, practices and norms of digital news media.Digital news media includes online journalism, blogging, digital photojournalism, citizen journalism and social media.•It includes questions about how professional journalism should use this ‘new media’ to research and publish stories, as well as how to use text or images provided by citizens.A REVOLUTION IN ETHICS••A media revolution is transforming, fundamentally and irrevocably, the nature of journalism and its ethics.The means to publish is now in the hands of citizens, while the internet encourages new forms of journalism that are interactive and immediate.•Our media ecology is a chaotic landscape evolving at a furious pace.Professional journalists share the journalistic sphere with tweeters, bloggers, citizen journalists, and social media users.•••Amid every revolution, new possibilities emerge while old practices are threatened.Today is no exception.••

Is Stewart a journalist ?Video :‘The Problem With Jon Stewart’ takes a serious leap into advocacy journalism ,Review by Brian Lowry, CNN , 30 September 2021.https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/30/entertain ment/the-problem-with-jon-stewart- review/index.htmlIs a person expressing their opinions on their Facebook site a journalist?ANONYMITY•Anonymity is accepted more readily online than in mainstream news media.Newspapers usually require the writers of letters to the editor to identify themselves.•••Codes of mainstream media ethics caution journalists to use anonymous sources sparingly and only if certain rules are followed.The codes warn journalists that people may use anonymity to take unfair or untrue “potshots” at other people, for self-interested reasons.•Online, many commentary and “chat” areas do not allow anonymity.Online users resist demands from web site and blogs to register and identify themselves.••Anonymity is praised as allowing freedom of speech and sometimes helping to expose wrongdoing.Critics say it encourages irresponsible and harmful comments.Mainstream media contradict themselves when they allow anonymity online but refuse anonymity in their newspapers and broadcast programs.•••The ethical question is: When is anonymity ethicallypermissible and is it inconsistent for media to enforce different rules on anonymity for different media platforms?•What should be the ethical guidelines for anonymity offline and online?  SPEED, RUMOR AND CORRECTIONS••Reports and images circulate the globe with amazing speed via Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, blogs, cell phones, and email.Speed puts pressure on newsrooms to publish stories before they are adequately checked and verified as to the source of the story and the reliability of the alleged facts.•Major news organizations too often pick up rumors online.Sometimes, the impact of publishing an online rumoris not world shaking –a false report that a hockey coach has been fired.•••But a media that thrives on speed and “sharing” creates the potential for great harm.For instance, news organizations might be tempted to repeat a false rumorthat terrorists had taken control of the London underground, or that a nuclear power plant had just experienced a ‘meltdown’ and dangerous gases were blowing towards Chicago.•Increasingly, journalists are blogging ‘live’ about sports games, news events, and breaking stories.Inevitably, when one works at this speed, errors are made, from misspelling words to making factual errors.•••These false reports could induce panic, causes accidents, prompt military action and so on.A related problem, created by new media, is how to handle errors and corrections when reports and commentary are constantly being updated.•Should news organizations go back and correct all of these mistakes which populate mountains of material?Or should they correct errors later and not leave a trace of the original mistake –what is called “unpublishing?”•••The ethical challenge is to articulate guidelines for dealing with rumorsand corrections in an online world that are consistent with the principles of accuracy, verification, and transparency.The ethical challenge is to redefine what independent journalism in the public interest means for a media where many new types of journalism are appearing and where basic principles are being challenged.ENTREPRENEURIAL NOT-FOR-PROFIT JOURNALISM••The declining readers and profits of mainstream media, as citizens migrate online, has caused newsrooms to shrink their staff.Some journalists doubt the continuing viability of the old economic model of a mass media based on advertising and circulation sales.••In response, many journalists have started not-for-profit newsrooms, news web sites, and centersof investigative journalism based on money from foundations and donations from citizens.Some journalists go online and ask for citizens to send them money to do stories.••This trend can be called “entrepreneurial journalism” because the journalist no longer simply reports while other people (e.g. advertising staff ) raise funds for their newsroom.These journalists are entrepreneurs attempting to raise funds for their new ventures.• •The new ventures raise ethical questions. How independent can such newsrooms be when they are so reliant on funds from a limited number of donors?•What happens if the newsroom intends to report anegative story about one of its main funders?•From whom will these newsrooms take money? •How transparent will they be about who gives them money and under what conditions?The challenge is to construct an ethics for this new area of journalism.•REPORTERS USING SOCIAL MEDIA•Many news organizations encourage their reporters to use social media to gather information and to create a “brand” for themselves by starting their own blog, Facebook page, or Twitter account. However, online commenting can put reporters, especially beat reporters, in trouble with their editors or the people they comment about, especially if the news outlet says it provides impartial reporting.•For example, a reporter who covers city hall may report dispassionately in her newspaper about a candidate for mayor.But on her blog, she may express strong opinion, saying the candidate is an unlikeable and incompetent politician.••Such comments would give the candidate cause to complain about the lack of impartiality of the reporter.The ethical challenge is to develop social media guidelines that allow reporters to explore the new media world but also to draw reasonable limits on personal commentary.•ETHICS OF IMAGES••There are the new ethical issues raised by the rise of new image technology.These images include both photographs and video.•Citizens and professional journalists have new and easy ways to capture and transmit images, such as cell phones linked to the internet via wireless technology.They have new technologies for altering and manipulating these images.•••This convergence of ease of capture, ease of transmission, and ease of manipulation questions the traditional principles of photojournalism which were developed for non-digital capture and transmission of pictures and video.As mentioned above, one issue is whether newsrooms can trust the easily obtained images of citizens and citizen journalists.•Who is the sender and how do we know that this imageis really of the event in question?•Another issue is whether a journalist or a citizen used technology to alter the photograph, e.g. to add an object to the picture or to take an object out. •The manipulation of images is so tempting that mainstream newsrooms have fired a string of photojournalists over the past decade to discourage fraudulent practices.Even with manipulation, not all issues are clear.•Reference2024 Guide to Ethical Photography and Copyright Complianceby Jana Ferreira 16 February 2024https://aftershoot.com/blog/ethical-photography/VideoEthics in Street Photographyby Zach Dobsonhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v3OOuc907sPhotography Ethics and Why They Matterhttps://www.photoethics.org/content/2018/5/31/photography-ethics-and-why-they-matterThe ethics of photojournalismTo shoot or to rescue?
•Changing the meaning or content of the image so as to mislead viewers is considered unethical.However, the line between a technical change and a change is meaning is not always clear.••••An image maker can enhance the colorsof a photo until it is quite unlike the original picture of the object or the event.Also, editors may argue that it permissible to alter images for the covers of fashion magazines (and other types of magazine) since the cover is a work of ‘art’ to attract buyers while they browse magazine stands.There is much for ethics to do to clarify the principles of responsible image making and how those principles apply to difficult cases.Fake News , Misinformation , Disinformation•The issue of “fake news” has been a dominant theme in the headlines for several years.How do we define a term that has come to mean so many different things to different people?•••Sometimes these stories may be propaganda that is intentionally designed to mislead the reader, or may be designed as “clickbait” written for economic incentives (the writer profits on the number of people who click on the story).At its core, we are defining “fake news” as those news stories that are false: the story itself is fabricated, with no verifiable facts, sources or quotes.••The term itself has become politicized and is widely used to discredit any opposing viewpoint.However, it’s important to acknowledge that“fake news” is a complex and nuanced problem, one that is far greater than the narrow definition above.••Some people use it to cast doubt on their opponents, controversial issues or the credibility of some media organizations.In addition, technological advances such as the advent of social media enable fake news stories to proliferate quickly and easily as people share more and more information online. ••Increasingly, we rely on online information tounderstand what is happening in our world.The universe of “fake news” is much larger than simply false news stories.••Some stories may have a nugget of truth but lack any contextualizing details.They may not include any verifiable facts or sources. Some stories may include basic verifiable facts, but are written using language that is deliberately inflammatory, leaves out pertinent details or only presents one viewpoint.•“Fake news” exists within a larger ecosystem ofmis-and disinformation.•Misinformation is false or inaccurate information that is mistakenly or inadvertently created or spread; the intent is not to deceive.•Disinformationis false information that is deliberately created and spread "in order to influence public opinion or obscure the truth" (https://www.merriam- webster.com/dictionary/disinformation).••Claire Wardle ofFirstDraftNews.comhas created thehelpful visual image below to help us think about the ecosystem of mis-and disinformation.And as she points out, "it's complicated."Misinformation and disinformation is produced for a variety of complex reasons:•Partisan actors want to influence voters and policymakers for political gain or to influence public discourse(for example, intentionally spreading misinformation about election fraud) .•More clicks means more money. Some news stories are created by people wanting to generate clicks for financial gain, regardless of the content(for example,Macedonian teenagers) .The Real Impact of Fake News: The Rise of Political Misinformation—and How We Can Combat Its InfluencePolitical Analytics , Strategic Communication , School of Professional Studies , COLUMBIA SPS2 January 2024https://sps.columbia.edu/news/real-impact-fake-news-rise-political-misinformation-and-how-we-can-combat-its-influence•The blurry lines between news and entertainment and the explosion of news sites, as well as the pressure of the 24 hour news cycle, may contribute to shoddywriting that doesn‘t follow professional journalistic standards or ethics••The technological ease of copying, pasting, clicking and sharing content online has helped misinformation and disinformation to proliferate.In some cases, stories are designed to provoke an emotional response and placed on certain sites ("seeded") in order to entice readers into sharing them widely.•In other cases, "fake news" articles may be generated and disseminated by "bots" -computer algorithms that are designed to act like people sharing information but can do so quickly and automatically.How Fake News Affects U.S. ElectionsBy Jenna Marina Lee, University of Central Florida, 26 October 2020https://www.ucf.edu/news/how-fake-news-affects-u-s-elections/Examples of Viral Fake News•"Donald Trump sent his own plane to transport 200 stranded marines”•A fake news story is picked up by a major media talk show host.•“FBI director received millions from Clinton Foundation, his brother’s law firm does Clinton’s taxes”•An unreliable and biased news site generates over 538,000 engagements on Facebook by using a fake headline.•"Pope Francis shocks world, endorses Donald Trump for president"Fake news site fools world media and generates 960,000 Facebook engagements.•Coronavirus Bioweapon –How China Stole Coronavirus From Canada And Weaponized It•One of a long list of fake Coronavirus news stories and articles.•Evidence Surfaces That The FBI Planned And Executed January 6 Capitol Riot•Example of a common far-right conspiracy theory regarding the January 6 riots.From :Fake News: Separating Truth From Fiction: 4.

These protections should also be embedded within a country’s constitution and/or national law.•Recognise that source protection should extend to all acts of journalism and across all platforms, services and mediums (of data storage and publication), and that it includes digital data and meta-data.Reference :Protecting Journalism Sources in the Digital Age, UNESCO Publishing , 2017.https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000248054AI in Data Journalism : What are the Ethical ImplicationsMost of the large media organizations in US use artificial intelligence in three key areas of the news production process:•story discovery•story generation and•story distribution.•Newsrooms that focus on speed, like the Associated Press and Bloomberg, employ AI in the story production step with automated content generation.Smaller newsrooms have focused more on using AI as a story discovery and reporting tool. Interviews conducted with 12 people who work in media, tech and law focused on the way their organizations incorporated ethical decision-making as they implemented their technology.••Many of the ethical issues facing artificial intelligence in journalism are issues that journalists already face, just in a different context.One example is the importance of having clean, reliable data, which is also imperative to data journalism.Another is the need for transparency and disclosure policies for automated content generated pieces, which media organizations already need to do for projects like investigative reporting.•••There are ethics codes for journalism and there are ethics codes for AI, but there are no widely known ethics codes for artificial intelligence use in journalism. Individual media organizations have certainly discussed ethical use of this technology, but few, if any at all, have added these concerns to their codes of ethics.•Other ethical situations, such as attribution and transparency, are specific to AI. There are not yet industry-wide standards for properly crediting or attributing content “written” via algorithm.Regulations, however, are not the same as ethics, and it’s important that media organizations have an ethical code to follow regardless of legislation.••This report proposes an ethical framework that media organizations can follow as they integrate artificial intelligence in their newsrooms.These guidelines focus on steps to consistently evaluate quality of data and algorithms, analyze potential bias in models and act transparently with AI-based endeavors.This framework was developed in conjunction with universal journalism values such as accuracy, fairness, respect and responsibility to the public (Society of Professional Journalists, n.d.).••Reference : AI in Journalism: Creating an Ethical Framework , by Haley Kim , Syracuse University SURFACE, Syracuse University HonorsProgram Capstone Projects , 1 May 2019.https://surface.syr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2095&co ntext=honors_capstone••Artificial intelligence won’t kill journalism or save it, but the sooner newsrooms buy in, the better, posted by Hanaa’ Tameez, NiemanLab, 18 November 2019.https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/11/artificial- intelligence-wont-kill-journalism-or-save-it-but-the- sooner-newsrooms-buy-in-the-better/Artificial intelligence is already being used in some newsrooms to mine data, create algorithms and automatically generate content.
